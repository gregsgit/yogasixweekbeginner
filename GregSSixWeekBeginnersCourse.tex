\chapter*{Overview / Goals}
\label{chap:overview}

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Overview/Goals}

The overriding goal of a class for beginning students is to instill an
enjoyment and appreciation of yoga practice. The goal is to give
beginning students a taste for the benefits of yoga practice, and to,
as much as possible, give these beginning students tools that they can
use to safely and joyfully continue to practice yoga. As Geeta Iyengar
writes in the preface of ``Yoga in Action: A Preliminary
Course''\cite{GeetaPC}, 

\begin{quote}
  \emph{Yoga in Action for Beginners is not the end, but the beginning of
  yoga. It is for the practitioner to ignite the hidden force of yoga
  from within, so that it throws the Light on the path of the yogic
  journey.}
\end{quote}

Of course, Preliminary Course gives a 28-week syllabus, and for this
assignment we are creating only a 6-week course.

The immediate goals of the first few classes are to help students
familiarize themselves with their bodies, and also with the
terminology we use to describe motions and poses in Iyengar Yoga
classes.

Yoga, and in particular asana practice, is not about how you look. If
your pose is not geometrically perfect, you are not a failure. One of
the lessons that yoga teaches is vairagya, detachment. Along with
detachment is non-judgement. Judging yourself, in an asana, as ``good''
or ``bad'' is not helpful. The question is ``what is the goal?'' How do
you strive towards the goal? In this way, asana practice is a
microcosm of ``life practice''. The concept of ``bringing yoga off the
mat'' is important


I have mostly followed the sequences given for the first six weeks in
Geeta Iyengar's \emph{Preliminary Course}\cite{GeetaPC}, abbreviated
``PC''. For each pose given, I indicate whether it was in that week's
sequence in PC, and, if so, which number in the sequence in PC.
For example, if the fourth pose in week 2 is \nam{}, and it is also
the fourth pose in the week 2 syllabus in PC, I will write:

w2.4 \nam{} \PC{2}{4}

\section*{Formatting Notes}
\label{chap:formatting}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Formatting Notes}

Pose names are italicized, as in \apose{this is a pose name}.

A new pose (not introduced earlier) will be both italicized and
colored blue, as in \newpose{\apose{this is a new pose}}.

Images of poses are taken from \emph{Preliminary Course}, as I do not
yet have images of myself in the poses.

\week{1}
\label{week:1}

\textbf{Themes}: What is yoga? Your body in space.

\textbf{Reading}: Something that relates asana to the rest of one's
life; how looking for alignment and balance in asana can be brought
``off the mat'' to bring alignment and balance in the rest of one's
life.

\section{Sequence for Week 1}
\label{seq:1}

\pose{\newpose{\sav{}} \hfill(not given as first pose in PC)}

\amsFig


Have several blankets available if needed.

Lie flat; legs together, toes pointing towards ceiling. Knees pointing
to ceiling. Hips level. Feel what parts of your body are touching the
ground. Is there equal weight on both heels? Both buttocks? Shoulder
blades?


Now bring your arms over your head. Can you reach all the way to the
ground? Use blankets if need support. How close are hands; can you
bring them closer together? Rotate your arms so that your palms face
the ceiling. Now reverse the rotation; which causes the shoulder
blades to separate? Try rolling the upper arms (nearer the shoulders)
\term{inward} so that palms turn toward floor. Now keep upper arms
turned in, but make palms parallel.

Now try to increase the distance between top of shoulders and ears
(i.e. lower shoulders) while keeping arms straight above head.

\pose{\newpose{\tad{}}, against a wall \PC{1}{1}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Now we are going to attempt to replicate the pose we just did
    on the floor, with the help of gravity, while standing.
  \item In \sav{}, the floor was a useful reference point -- we
    could tell if our hips were even, or our shoulder blades were
    even, by feeling the contact with the floor.
  \item Stand with your back lightly touching the wall; your heels as
    close to the wall as possible.
  \item Have your feet together.
  \item Is your weight balanced on your feet, left vs. right? Try
    shifting all your weight to your left foot; now the right foot.
  \item Is your weight evenly balanced forward and backward? That is,
    is the weight on the balls of your feet the same as the weight on
    your heels? Try moving forward, putting more weight on the balls
    of the feet. Now try lifting the toes, putting all the weight on
    the heels. Now back to even.
  \item Consider your left foot. Is the weight evenly balanced on the
    ``4 corners'' of the foot? Same for right foot.
  \item Remember what was touching the floor in Savasana? Lightly
    touching the wall, see if you can replicate the touchpoints from
    Savasana. Your heels, buttocks', shoulder blades, and back of
    head.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\urdhast{}} \PC{1}{2}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Now raise your arms above your head. This is called \urdhast{}
    (arms). Recall where they were when you were on your back; can you
    position them the same way without gravity? Turn your arms
    ``inward'' again, so that palms turn towards wall. Now keep upper
    arms turned, but make palms parallel.
  \item Lower shoulders away from ears.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\urdbad{}} \PC{1}{3}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bring your arms down to pointing straight in front of you.
  \item Clasp your hands. Note which thumb is on top. 
  \item Separate your wrists and rotate the thumb sides down. This is
    \badd{}.
  \item Raise your arms, keeping your hands in \badd{}; Straighten
    your arms, especially the elbows.
  \item Lower your arms, change the interlock of your fingers so that
    other thumb is on top, repeat.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\nam{}} \PC{1}{4}}

\pose{\newpose{\urdnam{}} from \urdhast{} \PC{1}{5}}


\textbf{Interlude}. So far everything has been perfectly straight and
balanced, left to right, top to bottom. Now we're going to branch out.

\pose{\newpose{Half \utt} (made up - not in PC)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bring mats to wall.
  \item Stand legs-distance from wall. Lean over so that torso is
    parallel to floor, forming right angle; hands touching wall. Above
    waist is Urdhva Hastasana (rotated 90\textdegree). Below waist is \tad.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\utthastpad} \PC{1}{6}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Left foot to wall.
  \item Separate feet 4-5 feet apart. Arms out, parallel to
    floor. Even balance front-to-back, left to right.
  \item Lift trunk and chest. Lower shoulders
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\parshastpad} \PC{1}{7}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Turn right leg out 90\textdegree. Right heel in line with
    center of left foot (both feet centered on mat). Toes pointing
    90\textdegree, left knee pointing 90\textdegree. Turn left foot in
    slightly. Everything else unchanged. Hips still parallel to long
    edge of mat; torso facing forward; face facing forward. Are hips
    even (same height)?
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\utttrik} \PC{1}{8}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Extend the right arm out as you bend at the waist and bring
    the right arm down to the shin. Place your left arm on your left
    waist. Keep your torso perpendicular to the ground, requiring
    rotation right-to-left of the torso. Now bring left arm up,
    pointing to ceiling; two arms going in opposite directions. Lower
    shoulders (increase distance between ears and shoulders). Are hips
    perpendicular to the wall?
  \item Come up, turn feet parallel.
  \item Optional variation: Can try parallel to wall, so that wall
    gives feedback to buttocks, shoulder blades, and head about
    alignment.
  \end{itemize}

(repeat Utthita Hasta Padasana, Parsva Hasta Padasana, Utthita
Trikonasana) on opposite side (left foot to the wall).

\pose{\newpose{\parsvo} (concave back) \PC{1}{9}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Grab two blocks.
  \item Left foot to wall, Parsva Hasta Padasana. Now turn back foot
    in more, and rotate hips to parallel wall. Hands to hips. Balance
    pelvis - front-to-back and side-to-side. Chest facing front of
    mat, head facing straight ahead.
  \item Extend back, make concave, look up.
  \item Now bend so that torso is parallel to floor (recall
    half-uttanasana).
  \item Put blocks at whatever height allows you to keep concave back.
  \item Repeat with right foot to wall.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\praspad} (concave back) \PC{1}{10}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wide separation of feet. Feet parallel to each other; even
    w.r.t. distance from edge of mat.
  \item Bend at waist so that torso is parallel to floor. Back
    concave. Hands directly below shoulders on floor. Use blocks if
    needed to get torso parallel to floor.
  \item Hips over (in line with) feet. Weight even front-to-back on
    feet. Feet flat, weight even inner-to-outer on feet.
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\dand}  \PC{1}{11}}

\pose{\newpose{\urdhastdand} \PC{1}{12}}

\pose{\newpose{\padadand} \PC{1}{13}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use a belt for integrity of back.
  \item Concave back
  \end{itemize}

\pose{\newpose{\paschi} \PC{1}{14}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is a good time to remind students to not be attached to
    the perfect form/geometry of the asana, but to consider the goals.
  \end{itemize}
